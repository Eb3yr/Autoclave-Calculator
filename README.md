# Autoclave-Calculator
Calculator for profit using autoclave in Growtopia

Takes inputs of:
Buy rate for regular surg tools,
Sell rate for regular surg tools,
Sell rate for stitches,
WLs spent

Outputs WLs received and overall profit.

I can't be bothered to get you to set buy and sell prices for each tool individually, if you want that yell at me on discord (Eb3yr#2996). If I messed up, also yell at me on discord.
I also couldn't be bothered to actually show that one tool isn't being produced by the autoclave. I've just deducted the equivalent from the profit and gross earnings at the end. Just ignore the numbers for the tool you're autoclaving
